# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manika Goel

A Computer Science Engineering student ðŸŽ“ at Shobhit Institute of Engineering and Technology, Meerut, passionate about technology ðŸ’» and problem-solving ðŸ’¡. I'm on a journey to explore innovative solutions through code ðŸš€ and a strong foundation in programming.

## What I'm Learning

I'm currently focused on building a solid foundation in programming with:

*   C/C++
*   Python
*   HTML
*   CSS
*   MySQL

I'm eager to delve deeper into:

*   Data Structures and Algorithms
*   Software Engineering
*   Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

## My Skills (in progress)

(I'm still learning and building my skills, but here's what I'm working on!)
